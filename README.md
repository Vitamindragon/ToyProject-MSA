# ToyProject-MSA
This project is designed to implement a Microservices Architecture (MSA). It aims to demonstrate how to build scalable and maintainable applications using independent services that communicate over APIs. 
Each service is responsible for a specific functionality, allowing for easier development, testing, and deployment.

Features
* Modular design with separate microservices
* RESTful API communication between services
* Easy scalability and maintainability
* Containerization support (e.g., Docker)
* Sample integration and deployment scripts
